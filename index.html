          Construction generates massive amounts of information, but it’s often scattered. A single data hub turns complexity into clarity, cutting through the noise. Leaders spend less time chasing numbers and more time driving results.

        <h3>Why Data Matters to a Construction Business</h3>
        <p class="tile-copy">
          Decisions happen every day. Which jobs to pursue. How to create the best quote. Where cost and schedule risk is rising. Strong use of data analytics can turn those choices from gut feelings into repeatable practices. Each business and workflow is unique, here are a few examples of how strong data practices and analytics can improve a construction business:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faster job reviews.</strong> See the status of projects in real time.</li>
          <li><strong>More accurate estimates.</strong> Use historical data to set realistic budgets, labor rates, and contingency.</li>
          <li><strong>Early risk detection.</strong> Spot changes as they are happening to reduce order drift, productivity dips, and long lead item delays.</li>
          <li><strong>Better win rate.</strong> Aim business development at work that fits your strengths and margins.</li>

    <!-- Four Stages of Analytics (bridge section) -->
<section id="analytics-stages" class="tiles-grid" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr;">
  <article class="tile-card">
    <h3>The Four Stages of Analytics</h3>
    <p class="stages-intro">
      At its core, data analytics means using past records to answer business questions. Instead of gut feel, decisions are informed by facts, numbers from projects, budgets, schedules, or costs.</p> 
    <p class="stages-intro">It’s about looking at patterns in your own history to understand what happened, why it happened, and what to do next. In order to do that, data analytics can be described as having four unique stages. Each stage builds on the last. Together they move the business from hindsight to foresight and action.
    </p>

    <div class="stage-flow">
      <article class="stage-card">
        <p><strong>Descriptive</strong> - gives visibility</p>
        <p class="stage-copy">What leaders look for when they ask, “What happened?”</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job cost vs. budget reports</li>
          <li>Earned value vs. planned value</li>
          <li>Project status dashboards</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <p><strong>Diagnostic</strong> - explains the "why"</p>
        <p class="stage-copy">Answering “why things went off track” questions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify causes of delays</li>
          <li>Spot subcontractor performance issues</li>
          <li>Analyze change order drivers</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Step 1: Centralize -->
    <section id="centralize" class="tiles-grid" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr;">
      <article class="tile-card">
        <h3>Step 1: Put the data in one place</h3>
        <p class="tile-copy">
          The first step is to collect the company’s history in a single, well-organized location. A simple option is to house all data in a <strong>relational database system</strong> such as a SQL Server database that lives in your environment or a cloud database.
        </p>

        <h4>What to bring together</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project facts:</strong> job number, customer, location, start and end dates, contract type.</li>
          <li><strong>Budget and cost:</strong> original budget, revisions, actuals, committed cost, change orders.</li>
          <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> planned vs actual milestones, critical items, delays.</li>
          <li><strong>Labor and productivity:</strong> timesheets or cost codes, crew sizes, units installed.</li>
          <li><strong>Procurement:</strong> subcontracts, POs, lead times, delivery dates.</li>
          <li><strong>Billings and cash:</strong> pay apps, percent complete, retainage, collections.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety and quality:</strong> incidents, inspections, punch items.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Why centralization matters</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One source of truth.</strong> Leadership, PMs, and accounting look at the same numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Reusability.</strong> Dashboards, ad-hoc questions, and models all read from the same tables.</li>
          <li><strong>Lower effort.</strong> No more rebuilding spreadsheets for every meeting.</li>
          <li><strong>Security and control.</strong> Access to the database is restricted to only those who need it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How the build-out works</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inventory the systems.</strong> ERP, estimating, scheduling, field apps, shared drives.</li>
          <li><strong>Define the core tables.</strong> Projects, budgets, actuals, change orders, milestones, timesheets.</li>
          <li><strong>Move the history.</strong> Load historical CSVs or exports into the database.</li>
          <li><strong>Automate fresh data.</strong> Set daily or hourly loads so the warehouse stays current.</li>
          <li><strong>Document access.</strong> Who can read which tables. How to request changes.</li>
        </ol>

          Once the data is centralized, the four types of analytics can be used to answer everyday questions in minutes and prepare for deeper analysis.

          The same approach works with your real data. We can start with read-only access and build value step by step.

          The Predictive and Prescriptive dashboards shown here are <strong>illustrative demos only</strong>. True predictive forecasting and prescriptive recommendations require advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep domain expertise. These examples are simplified mockups using synthetic data to show what could be possible, not actual data science outputs.
