# Project Analytics Dashboards (Demo)

This repository contains a series of interactive dashboards demonstrating the **four stages of analytics** — *Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive*.  
The dashboards are built as a teaching/portfolio tool and use **simulated data** (CSV files), not production or real-world project data.

## 📊 Dashboards
- **Descriptive Analytics**  
  - Project counts by year/month  
  - Total planned vs actual cost  
  - Average project cost and duration  
  - Change orders (count/cost trends)

- **Diagnostic Analytics**  
  - Change orders by reason (mapped categories)  
  - CO cost breakdowns by year/month  
  - Trends highlighting “why” differences occurred

- **Predictive Analytics**  
  - Mock-up projections of project costs  
  - Example trend lines (hypothetical)  
  - ⚠️ *Demo only: not trained models*

- **Prescriptive Analytics**  
  - What-if scenario exploration  
  - Recommended adjustments for budgeting  
  - ⚠️ *Demo only: requires advanced data science in real use*

## 🛠️ Built With
- [**D3.js**](https://d3js.org/) – for CSV data loading & transforms  
- [**Chart.js**](https://www.chartjs.org/) – for rendering responsive charts  
- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (Vanilla)** – no framework overhead  
- **GitHub Pages** – static hosting

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
The **Predictive** and **Prescriptive** dashboards use *simulated examples only*.  
They demonstrate the *concepts* of advanced analytics, but real-world usage would require proper data science methods, forecasting models, and domain expertise.
